# Adding your team's logo
1. Fork the repository.
2. Add an image, titled `####.png`, where `####` is your team number, to the `logos` folder. Then, in `data.js`, add your team number to the `icons` array at the bottom of the document.
3. Open a pull request from your fork back into the origin.
4. That's it!
